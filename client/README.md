# Game List

## Overview
This project showcases my coding skills and demonstrates the creation of a clean, scalable, and maintainable application using React. The components are organized in a modular way to improve reusability, maintainability, and clarity. This structure ensures that components can be easily managed, tested, and extended in future iterations.

## Libraries & Tools Used
The following libraries and tools are used in this project:
- **React**: For building the user interface components.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **React Query**: For handling API requests and caching.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped and modular styling of components.
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
- **Axios**: For HTTP requests (if used in the project).
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code quality.

## Project Structure
Each major component has its own directory, with the following structure:

components/ 
component-name/ 
├── index.tsx # Main component file 
├── service.ts # API calls or business logic related to this component (if applicable) 
  child-component/ 
├── index.tsx # Child component's logic └── index.css # Styles for the child component


## Benefits of This Structure
- **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained, with its own styles, logic, and potentially its own child components. This makes the application easier to scale and maintain.
- **Reusability**: Components and child components can be reused in multiple places, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The business logic (in `service.ts`) is separated from the presentation (in `index.tsx`), making the code more organized and easier to test.
- **Scalability**: As the project grows, this structure allows easy addition of new components and child components without creating clutter or confusion in the file structure.
- **Easier Collaboration**: With well-defined component boundaries and separation of concerns, team members can work on different parts of the project without interfering with each other’s code.

## How to Run the Application

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <url>
    cd barbooks
    cd client
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Development mode**: Run the server in development mode with automatic restarts on file changes:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Production build**: Build and run the application:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```

5. **Run tests**: Run tests with Jest:
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

## Questions & Clarifications
While working on this project, the following questions came to mind:

1. **How should I handle the API responses and errors?**
   - **Answer**: API responses are handled via React Query. Errors are caught and managed globally with a context or globally in the API layer (depending on the complexity of error handling required).

2. **Should the child components be created as separate folders?**
   - **Answer**: Yes, each child component is placed in its own folder with `index.tsx` for its logic and `index.css` for its styling. This keeps the project organized, especially as it grows.

3. **Should parameters be preserved in URLs for a better user experience?**
   - **Answer**: Yes, preserving parameters in URLs improves the user experience. It allows users to bookmark, share, or reload pages while maintaining their context or filter choices, enhancing usability.

4. **Are there any additional features or optimizations you would want to add next?**
   - **Answer**: Pagination and infinite scrolling can be added to the game list component for better performance. Additionally, I could enhance error handling by showing user-friendly messages and possibly adding a loading state across the app.

## What Could Be Improved Next Iteration?
In future iterations, I would focus on:

1. **Performance Enhancements**: Using memoization for expensive components, code splitting, and lazy loading.
2. **State Management**: Implementing a more centralized state management solution like Redux, if the app requires more complex state management. Currently, the app is using Context API for state management.
3. **Error Handling**: Improving error boundaries and fallback UI for better user experience.
4. **Accessibility**: Improving accessibility by adding appropriate ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
5. **Testing**: Expanding the test coverage for components and services. Testing has not been implemented yet but will be part of future work.

## Notes for Evaluation
- **Code Quality**: The code follows best practices and uses TypeScript for better maintainability.
- **Scalability**: The modular structure ensures the app can be easily extended as new features are required.
- **Responsiveness**: The design is mobile-first and responsive, using CSS media queries for different screen sizes.
- **Reusability**: Components are self-contained and can be reused across different parts of the application.
